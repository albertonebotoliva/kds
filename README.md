# Technical Test for KDS

DEMO - http://testkds.s3-website.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/

In this test, you will develop a SPA with React to browse an API endpoint. 
(choose one of the public APIs from here: https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis)

Showcase a data table (including pagination) with a brief description (max five columns),
where the user can click on one of the elements and show the full description of the item.

### Requirements:

- Use React, ideally with redux too
- Choose your own UI components library (internally we use our home made library, but you are free to choose whichever you want)
- Versioning the code with git
- Bonus: showcase the API by deploying it(hint: github pages, zeit.co, heroku, â€¦)


### Considerations

- Used React + Redux + TypeScript - Based on https://github.com/rokoroku/react-redux-typescript-boilerplate

- Used Material-UI as a graphic framework - https://material-ui.com/

- Deployed in AWS S3 container - http://testkds.s3-website.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/

- Test environment - Jest & Testing-library
